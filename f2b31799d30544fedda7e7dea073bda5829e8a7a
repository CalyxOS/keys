Is the symlinking necessary as part of some script?",

I was going to symlink within all */ originally, but there are older, unsupported devices in there so I got confused.\n\n\u003e They aren\u0027t referenced by anything, just used as a set to have the same structure as what we use for signing, so it can be used with the same scripts.\n\nOkay, I see what you mean.",
